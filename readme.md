- *Vanilla Centered TF2 Hud with default health and ammo in the middle*
# Description
**It clears the clutters and keeps the Shit.**

**In other words, this HUD moves everything to the center of your screen while keeping the default TF2 art style that we all SHOULD love. It's middle, & it's modern.**

**In other-other words, this is NOT another generic hud with random numbers floating at the centre of the screen. You weirdos.**

# Features Include
- Vac icon now under cursor
- Viewmodel on bottom left
- chat on bottom left
- damage numbers moved down slightly

The mean reason I had these changes was because when the chat was in the middle it was kinda getting in the way of the uncletopia map selection

# Install Instructions
**ONLYT INSTALL FROM THE RELEASES**
reason being is because idk how to sync up the files to the master so Imma just upload it to the releases

2. Open the zip
